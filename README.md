## Overview

### Purpose of the project

This code is being developed as a solution to the Blockchain project for the
Java Core track of the educational platform [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/tracks).
The main purpose is to showcase the author's software capabilities and
knowledge.

### Skills demonstrated

* The author is currently learning test driven development and elements of this
  practice have been applied in the development of the code.
* Unit testing with Junit 5. Some tests also feature mocking with Mockito.
* Basic use of Gradle for automated builds and dependency management.


### Example output

The _Blockchain_ application generates blockchains, printing information about
them to standard output. Each block in the blockchain has an ID, a timestamp
representing the time the block was created (as the number of milliseconds since
the standard Java epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00), the SHA-256 hash of the previous
block in the chain and the hash of the block itself.

A _proof of work_ number is supplied by the user at the beginning of the
application. This is the number of zeros each block's hash should begin with, in
order to prove the work done to find a block to add to the blockchain. Each
block has a _magic number_ â€“ a number found to make the block's hash
satisfy this proof of work criteria. The time taken to generate the block is
also displayed.

An example of the output is as follows:

```text
Enter how many zeros the hash must start with: 5

Magic number: 110846

## Dependencies

A local installation of a Java Development Kit is required to run _Blockchain_.


## Running the app

_Blockchain_ comes with a [Gradle](https://gradle.org) wrapper script to build it; see
the [Gradle docs on the wrapper script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper)
for more information. There are several options for building and/or running the
application. Navigate to the Blockchain root directory and execute one of the
following commands. (Note: code is given for Unix systems; for Windows, replace
calls to the executable `gradlew` with the batch script `gradlew.bat` and change
the file path syntax).


### Run with Gradle

The first option is to use the Gradle run task to run _Blockchain_:
```shell
./gradlew run
```


### Generate JAR file

The second option is to generate an executable JAR file and then run it with
a local Java distribution. Generate the JAR file using the following command:
```shell
./gradlew jar
```
This will generate the file in `./app/build/libs/app-0.2.0-dev.jar`, which can be
run in the usual way:
```shell
java -jar app/build/libs/app-0.2.0-dev.jar
```


### Generate a distribution with executable

A third option is to generate a distribution of the application and use the
accompanying executable shell (or batch) script that Gradle produces. Generate a
distribution by running
```shell
./gradlew assemble
```
This will generate archives `app-0.2.0-dev.tar` and `app-0.2.0-dev.zip` of the
application in the directory `./app/build/distributions`. Unpack the archive of
your choice and then run the `bin/app` shell script (or `bin\app.batch` script)
within.
